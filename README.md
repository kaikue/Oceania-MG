TODO
--
- Test ore rendering
- World generation
	- Island/surface biomes
		- Balance depth so that only island/surface is at y=0
	- Lerp biomes
	- Add another noise function worth of caves
	- Ore
		- Variable # of noise functions per ore type? (cluster frequency)
		- Variable noise cutoff? (cluster size)
		- Variable point division factor? (cluster spacing)
	- Sky biome with clouds
- Input
	- cursor position- mouse or right joystick (for targeting, inventory)
		- should snap back when not held for targeting
	- button selection in menus- use mouse if moving, up/down/left/right on keyboard/gamepad if mouse not moved
	- make inventories work with gamepad
	- In-game rebinding menu
- Rendering
	- Pipes/kelp render type- 4x4 spritesheet
	- Render block as item (scaled down by 50%, connected texture uses single block texture)
	- Viewport
	- color tint or just outline for player target? lightening is hard especially above water
		- darker for background? or both?
	- Randomized textures render type (combine with CTM?)
	- Water- no texture, bigger scrolling background
- Copy over everything from Python
	- World generating/saving/loading chunks
	- Player
		- Fixed, square (or circular???) bounding box
		- Nice movement that slides you into 1 block gaps
	- Menus
		- Options- gameplay, block scale
	- Entities
	- Inventory
	- Sound
- Make sure serialization works
	- references (including Player)
	- image reloading
- Performance testing
	- try with big window and scale=1
	- Garbage collection causing lag spikes?
		- pause GC and only collect when pausing?
	- generate/load/save chunks in background thread
- Everything from old README
- Use Monogame color tint to highlight targeted block (is it possible to lighten this way? seems to use multiply filter...)
- Nicer background without water texture (gray tint for background blocks, no overlay)
- Spawn rates based on liveliness
- Biomes
	- Surface
		- Island
		- Glacier
	- Shallow
		- Beach
		- Rocky shore
		- Neritic zone
		- Mangrove forest
		- Seagrass bed
		- Kelp forest
		- Choral reef
		- Ice edge
		- Seamounts- cobalt crusts
		- Trench? (hadal zone)
	- Cave
		- Lava tube
		- Basalt cave
		- more caves...
	- Abyss
		- Too dark to see without bringing a light source
	- Core
		- Too hot, damages you if you don't have heat protection
		- Need increasing levels of heat protection to go deeper
		- Put some endgame ores/structures here
- Fish breeding for automated resources?
- Phosphorus for heat generation?
- Mod support
	- Load blocks, biomes, entities, etc. from Mods folder
- Enemies
	- Surface
		- Birds (from Animals RPG Sprites)
		- Flying rays https://i.imgur.com/SyGVm1y.gif
	- Cave
		- Pulls back and springs towards you
		- Shoots grapple hook towards you and pulls along it
		- Stationary guys that shoot lasers spinning around
